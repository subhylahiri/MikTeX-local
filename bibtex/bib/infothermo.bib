abstract = {We introduce a metric for probability distributions, which is bounded, information-theoretically motivated, and has a natural Bayesian interpretation. The square root of the well-known $\chi$2 distance is an asymptotic approximation to it. Moreover, it is a close relative of the capacitory discrimination and Jensen-Shannon divergence.},

@article{Nulton1985dissdist,
abstract = {The proportionality between the square of the distance traversed as measured in thermodynamic length and the minimum associated dissipation of a process is established in a new context independent of dynamical laws. A quasistatic thermodynamic process consisting of K steps, each equilibrating with an appropriate reservoir, is optimized with respect to the position of the steps and the allocation of the total time $\tau$ for the process among the steps. It is found that the steps should be of equal thermodynamic length. For large K the bounds based on thermodynamic length are recovered.},
