Many changing cellular conditions can be represented as transitions between nonequilibrium steady states, and organisms have an interest in optimizing such transitions. Using the Hatano-Sasa Y-value, we extend a recently developed geometrical framework for determining optimal protocols so that it can be applied to systems driven from nonequilibrium steady states. We calculate and numerically verify optimal protocols for a colloidal particle dragged through solution by a translating optical trap with two controllable parameters. We offer experimental predictions, specifically that optimal protocols are significantly less costly than naive ones. Optimal protocols similar to these may ultimately point to design principles for biological energy transduction systems and guide the design of artificial molecular machines.},

@article{Glauber1963,
abstract = {The individual spins of the Ising model are assumed to interact with an external agency (e.g., a heat reservoir) which causes them to change their states randomly with time. Coupling between the spins is introduced through the assumption that the transition probabilities for any one spin depend on the values of the neighboring spins. This dependence is determined, in part, by the detailed balancing condition obeyed by the equilibrium state of the model. The Markoff process which describes the spin functions is analyzed in detail for the case of a closed N‐member chain. The expectation values of the individual spins and of the products of pairs of spins, each of the pair evaluated at a different time, are found explicitly. The influence of a uniform, time‐varying magnetic field upon the model is discussed, and the frequency‐dependent magnetic susceptibility is found in the weak‐field limit. Some fluctuation‐dissipation theorems are derived which relate the susceptibility to the Fourier transform of the time‐dependent correlation function of the magnetization at equilibrium.},

 where the system is quenched from equilibrium at T i > 0 to some arbitrary T ≥ 0. By way of

 From the standard mapping, these also imply new exact results for two-time particle correlation and

@article{Lan2012,
abstract = {Adaptation is the essential process by which an organism becomes better suited to its environment. The benefits of adaptation are well documented, but the cost it incurs remains poorly understood. Here, by analysing a stochastic model of a minimum feedback network underlying many sensory adaptation systems, we show that adaptive processes are necessarily dissipative, and continuous energy consumption is required to stabilize the adapted state. Our study reveals a general relation among energy dissipation rate, adaptation speed and the maximum adaptation accuracy. This energy-speed-accuracy relation is tested in the Escherichia coli chemosensory system, which exhibits near-perfect chemoreceptor adaptation. We identify key requirements for the underlying biochemical network to achieve accurate adaptation with a given energy budget. Moreover, direct measurements confirm the prediction that adaptation slows down as cells gradually de-energize in a nutrient-poor medium without compromising adaptation accuracy. Our work provides a general framework to study cost-performance tradeoffs for cellular regulatory functions and information processing.},

Surprisingly, this precision is higher than simple estimates of the fundamental physical limit, hinting towards active sensing strategies. In this work, we analyse the effect of cell memory, e.g. from slow biochemical processes, on the precision of sensing by cell-surface receptors. We derive analytical formulas, which show that memory significantly improves sensing in weakly fluctuating environments. However, surprisingly when memory is adjusted dynamically, the precision is always improved, even in strongly fluctuating environments. In support of this prediction we quantify the directional biases in chemotactic Dictyostelium discoideum cells in a flow chamber with alternating chemical gradients. The strong similarities between cell sensing and control engineering suggest universal problem-solving strategies of living matter.},

abstract = {Negative feedback is common in biological processes and can increase a system's stability to internal and external perturbations. But at the molecular level, control loops always involve signalling steps with finite rates for random births and deaths of individual molecules. Here we show, by developing mathematical tools that merge control and information theory with physical chemistry, that seemingly mild constraints on these rates place severe limits on the ability to suppress molecular fluctuations. Specifically, the minimum standard deviation in abundances decreases with the quartic root of the number of signalling events, making it extremely expensive to increase accuracy. Our results are formulated in terms of experimental observables, and existing data show that cells use brute force when noise suppression is essential; for example, regulatory genes are transcribed tens of thousands of times per cell cycle. The theory challenges conventional beliefs about biochemical accuracy and presents an approach to the rigorous analysis of poorly characterized biological systems.},

In particular, we investigate the relationship between the minimum dissipation of free energy required for a given error frequency in such systems. Several conclusions can be drawn from the present treatment: first, the ultimate accuracy of error correcting selective pathways is set by the displacement from equilibrium of the nucleoside triphosphates. Second, it is advantageous to achieve a desired accuracy at a small energy dissipation with several checking steps rather than a single one. This could explain antinomies in the amino acylation reaction as well as in mRNA translation, where small structural differences lead to large differences in flow rates between right and wrong substrates. Third, all checking steps should contribute equally to the accuracy, which implies a specific and symmetrical set of rate constants for the checking events on the enzyme.},

abstract = {Proofreading mechanisms increase specificity in biochemical reactions by allowing for the dissociation of intermediate complexes. These mechanisms disrupt and reset the reaction to undo errors at the cost of increased time of reaction and free energy expenditure. Here, we draw an analogy between proofreading and microtubule growth which share some of the features described above. Our analogy relates the statistics of growth and shrinkage of microtubules in physical space to the cycling of intermediate complexes in the space of chemical states in proofreading mechanisms. Using this analogy, we find a new kinetic regime of proofreading in which an exponential speed-up of the process can be achieved at the cost of a somewhat larger error rate. This regime is analogous to the transition region between two known growth regimes of microtubules (bounded and unbounded) and is sharply defined in the limit of large proofreading networks. We find that this advantageous regime of speed-error tradeoff might be present in proofreading schemes studied earlier in the charging of tRNA by tRNA synthetases, in RecA filament assembly on ssDNA, and in protein synthesis by ribosomes.},

The displacement from equilibrium, which is restrictive for the discrimination, is explicitly taken into account. This means that the process is consistent with the principle of detailed balance. It proceeds in such a way that the molecules to be selected are associated together with nucleoside triphosphates to an enzyme complex. After an initial selection, hydrolysis takes place, whereafter there is a repeated testing in several steps. Our basic idea is that real proofreading systems are designed to use the energy of the triphosphate in the most efficient way to achieve a satisfactory accuracy, and therefore there should exist optimum kinetic properties of the system. A suitable formalism for finding such optimum situations is developed which yields new possibilities to interpret experimental data.},

abstract = {In living cells, the specificity of biomolecular recognition can be amplified and the noise from non-specific interactions can be reduced at the expense of cellular free energy. This is the seminal idea in the Hopfield-Ninio theory of kinetic proofreading: The specificity is increased via cyclic network kinetics without altering molecular structures and equilibrium affinites. We show a thermodynamic limit of the specificity amplification with a given amount of available free energy. For a normal cell under physiological condition with sustained phosphorylation potential, this gives a factor of 10(10) as the upper bound in specificity amplification. We also study an optimal kinetic network design that is capable of approaching the thermodynamic limit.},

@article{Savageau1979,
abstract = {Aminoacylation of tRNA occurs with a high degree of accuracy in many cases because misacylated molecules are effectively proofread on the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase by preferential hydrolysis. This hydrolysis releases an ATP equivalent of energy. An explicit relationship between cost of proofreading and the resulting degree of accuracy is presented. Experimental data from Escherichia coli for isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase proofreading valyl-tRNAIle are examined by means of this relationship, and a conjecture concerning the natural selection of accuracy and proofreading costs is put forth and tested. We have found the energy cost of accurate proofreading to be high. The minimum error, derived in previous theoretical studies, is never actually reached. Instead, higher values, determined by the balance between energy wasted in the cell as a consequence of error and the energy cost of proofreading, appear to be selected. The total cost of proofreading all types of tRNA aminoacylations is estimated to be approximately 2\% of the energy required to synthesize a bacterial cell.},

@article{Freter1980,
abstract = {The phenomenal accuracy of biological discrimination is due in many cases to specific proofreading mechanisms. We have previously developed a macroscopic theory of such mechanisms and applied it to the case of single-stage proofreading. In this article we apply the theory to systems with multiple stages of proofreading. A specific relationship between improved accuracy due to proofreading and the associated energy cost is given. This is a macroscopic relationship that must be satisfied regardless of the details of the underlying mechanisms. Five factors in the design of such systems are shown to influence their overall accuracy: (1) initial discrimination, (2) number of proofreading stages, (3) proofreading discrimination of each stage, (4) distribution of proofreading effort among the stages, and (5) total energy expended for proofreading. We show that there is an optimal distribution of proofreading effort that, for a given degree of accuracy, minimizes the energy cost of proofreading. We also provide a simple physical interpretation of this minimum condition. These results are used to examine proofreading in two experimental systems for which there is appropriate data available in the literature: the valyl-tRNA synthetase catalyzed misacylation of tRNAVal with threonine and the isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase catalyzed misacylation of tRNAIle with valine. The correlation between the magnitude of a discrimination factor and the size of the corresponding enzymatic cavity is discussed.},

This fundamental physical limit is generally considered to be the Berg-Purcell limit [Biophys. J. 20, 193 (1977)]. Here we derive a lower limit by applying maximum likelihood to the time series of receptor occupancy. The increased accuracy stems from solely considering the unoccupied time intervals--disregarding the occupied time intervals as these do not contain any information about the external particle concentration, and only decrease the accuracy of the concentration estimate. Receptors which minimize the bound time intervals achieve the highest possible accuracy. We discuss how a cell could implement such an optimal sensing strategy by absorbing or degrading bound particles.},

@article{Mehta2012,
abstract = {Cells often perform computations in order to respond to environmental cues. A simple example is the classic problem, first considered by Berg and Purcell, of determining the concentration of a chemical ligand in the surrounding media. On general theoretical grounds, it is expected that such computations require cells to consume energy. In particular, Landauer's principle states that energy must be consumed in order to erase the memory of past observations. Here, we explicitly calculate the energetic cost of steady-state computation of ligand concentration for a simple two-component cellular network that implements a noisy version of the Berg-Purcell strategy. We show that learning about external concentrations necessitates the breaking of detailed balance and consumption of energy, with greater learning requiring more energy. Our calculations suggest that the energetic costs of cellular computation may be an important constraint on networks designed to function in resource poor environments, such as the spore germination networks of bacteria.},

Recent work has shown that when a thermodynamic system is driven from equilibrium then, in the linear response regime, the space of controllable parameters has a Riemannian geometry induced by a generalized friction tensor. We exploit this geometric insight to construct closed-form expressions for minimal-dissipation protocols for a particle diffusing in a one-dimensional harmonic potential, where the spring constant, inverse temperature, and trap location are adjusted simultaneously. These optimal protocols are geodesics on the Riemannian manifold and reveal that this simple model has a surprisingly rich geometry. We test these optimal protocols via a numerical implementation of the Fokker-Planck equation and demonstrate that the friction tensor arises naturally from a first-order expansion in temporal derivatives of the control parameters, without appealing directly to linear response theory.},

@article{Sartori2014,
abstract = {Biological sensory systems react to changes in their surroundings. They are characterized by fast response and slow adaptation to varying environmental cues. Insofar as sensory adaptive systems map environmental changes to changes of their internal degrees of freedom, they can be regarded as computational devices manipulating information. Landauer established that information is ultimately physical, and its manipulation subject to the entropic and energetic bounds of thermodynamics. Thus the fundamental costs of biological sensory adaptation can be elucidated by tracking how the information the system has about its environment is altered. These bounds are particularly relevant for small organisms, which unlike everyday computers operate at very low energies. In this paper, we establish a general framework to the thermodynamics of information processing in sensing. With it, we quantify how during sensory adaptation information about the past is erased, while information about the present is gathered. This process produces entropy larger than the amount of old information erased and has an energetic cost bounded by the amount of new information written to memory. We apply these principles to the E. coli's chemotaxis pathway during binary ligand concentration changes. In this regime, we quantify the amount of information stored by each methyl group, and show that receptors consume energy in the range of the information-theoretic minimum. Our work provides a basis for further inquiries into more complex phenomena, such as gradient sensing, frequency response, and signal amplification.},

@article{Govern2014resource,
abstract = {Living cells deploy many resources to sense their environments, including receptors, downstream signaling molecules, time, and fuel. However, it is not known which resources fundamentally limit the precision of sensing, like weak links in a chain, and which can compensate each other, leading to trade-offs between them. We present a theory for the optimal design of the large class of sensing systems in which a receptor drives a push-pull network. The theory identifies three classes of resources that are required for sensing: receptors and their integration time, readout molecules, and energy (fuel turnover). Each resource class sets a fundamental sensing limit, which means that the sensing precision is bounded by the limiting resource class and cannot be enhanced by increasing another class-the different classes cannot compensate each other. This result yields a previously unidentified design principle, namely that of optimal resource allocation in cellular sensing. It states that, in an optimally designed sensing system, each class of resources is equally limiting so that no resource is wasted. We apply our theory to what is arguably the best-characterized sensing system in biology, the chemotaxis network of Escherichia coli. Our analysis reveals that this system obeys the principle of optimal resource allocation, indicating a selective pressure for the efficient design of cellular sensing systems.},

abstract = {The usual general-purpose computing automaton (e.g., a Turing machine) is logically irreversible—its transition function lacks a single-valued inverse. Here it is shown that such machines may be made logically reversible at every step, while retaining their simplicity and their ability to do general computations. This result is of great physical interest because it makes plausible the existence of thermodynamically reversible computers which could perform useful computations at useful speed while dissipating considerably less than kT of energy per logical step. In the first stage of its computation the logically reversible automaton parallels the corresponding irreversible automaton, except that it saves all intermediate results, thereby avoiding the irreversible operation of erasure. The second stage consists of printing out the desired output. The third stage then reversibly disposes of all the undesired intermediate results by retracing the steps of the first stage in backward order (a process which is only possible because the first stage has been carried out reversibly), thereby restoring the machine (except for the now-written output tape) to its original condition. The final machine configuration thus contains the desired output and a reconstructed copy of the input, but no other undesired data. The foregoing results are demonstrated explicitly using a type of three-tape Turing machine. The biosynthesis of messenger RNA is discussed as a physical example of reversible computation.},

abstract = {Transitions between nonequilibrium steady states obey a generalized Clausius inequality, which becomes an equality in the quasistatic limit. For slow but finite transitions, we show that the behavior of the system is described by a response matrix whose elements are given by a far-from-equilibrium Green-Kubo formula, involving the decay of correlations evaluated in the nonequilibrium steady state. This result leads to a fluctuation-dissipation relation between the mean and variance of the nonadiabatic entropy production, {\$}\backslashDelta s{\_}{\{}\backslashrm na{\}}{\$}. Furthermore, our results extend -- to nonequilibrium steady states -- the thermodynamic metric structure introduced by Sivak and Crooks for analyzing minimal-dissipation protocols for transitions between equilibrium states.},

@article{Skoge2011coop,
abstract = {Cooperative interactions among sensory receptors provide a general mechanism to increase the sensitivity of signal transduction. In particular, bacterial chemotaxis receptors interact cooperatively to produce an ultrasensitive response to chemoeffector concentrations. However, cooperativity between receptors in large macromolecular complexes is necessarily based on local interactions and consequently is fundamentally connected to slowing of receptor-conformational dynamics, which increases intrinsic noise. Therefore, it is not clear whether or under what conditions cooperativity actually increases the precision of the concentration measurement. We explicitly calculate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for sensing a concentration change using a simple, Ising-type model of receptor-receptor interactions, generalized via scaling arguments, and find that the optimal SNR is always achieved by independent receptors.},
