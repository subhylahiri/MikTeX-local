abstract = {We introduce a metric for probability distributions, which is bounded, information-theoretically motivated, and has a natural Bayesian interpretation. The square root of the well-known $\chi$2 distance is an asymptotic approximation to it. Moreover, it is a close relative of the capacitory discrimination and Jensen-Shannon divergence.},

@article{Nulton1985dissdist,
abstract = {The proportionality between the square of the distance traversed as measured in thermodynamic length and the minimum associated dissipation of a process is established in a new context independent of dynamical laws. A quasistatic thermodynamic process consisting of K steps, each equilibrating with an appropriate reservoir, is optimized with respect to the position of the steps and the allocation of the total time $\tau$ for the process among the steps. It is found that the steps should be of equal thermodynamic length. For large K the bounds based on thermodynamic length are recovered.},

@article{Zulkowski2013,
abstract = {Biological systems fundamentally exist out of equilibrium in order to preserve organized structures and processes. Many changing cellular conditions can be represented as transitions between nonequilibrium steady states, and organisms have an interest in optimizing such transitions. Using the Hatano-Sasa Y-value, we extend a recently developed geometrical framework for determining optimal protocols so that it can be applied to systems driven from nonequilibrium steady states. We calculate and numerically verify optimal protocols for a colloidal particle dragged through solution by a translating optical trap with two controllable parameters. We offer experimental predictions, specifically that optimal protocols are significantly less costly than naive ones. Optimal protocols similar to these may ultimately point to design principles for biological energy transduction systems and guide the design of artificial molecular machines.},
