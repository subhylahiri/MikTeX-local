@article{Nulton1985dissdist,
abstract = {The proportionality between the square of the distance traversed as measured in thermodynamic length and the minimum associated dissipation of a process is established in a new context independent of dynamical laws. A quasistatic thermodynamic process consisting of K steps, each equilibrating with an appropriate reservoir, is optimized with respect to the position of the steps and the allocation of the total time $\tau$ for the process among the steps. It is found that the steps should be of equal thermodynamic length. For large K the bounds based on thermodynamic length are recovered.},

@article{Zulkowski2013noneq,
abstract = {Biological systems fundamentally exist out of equilibrium in order to preserve organized structures and processes. Many changing cellular conditions can be represented as transitions between nonequilibrium steady states, and organisms have an interest in optimizing such transitions. Using the Hatano-Sasa Y-value, we extend a recently developed geometrical framework for determining optimal protocols so that it can be applied to systems driven from nonequilibrium steady states. We calculate and numerically verify optimal protocols for a colloidal particle dragged through solution by a translating optical trap with two controllable parameters. We offer experimental predictions, specifically that optimal protocols are significantly less costly than naive ones. Optimal protocols similar to these may ultimately point to design principles for biological energy transduction systems and guide the design of artificial molecular machines.},

@article{Glauber1963,
abstract = {The individual spins of the Ising model are assumed to interact with an external agency (e.g., a heat reservoir) which causes them to change their states randomly with time. Coupling between the spins is introduced through the assumption that the transition probabilities for any one spin depend on the values of the neighboring spins. This dependence is determined, in part, by the detailed balancing condition obeyed by the equilibrium state of the model. The Markoff process which describes the spin functions is analyzed in detail for the case of a closed N‐member chain. The expectation values of the individual spins and of the products of pairs of spins, each of the pair evaluated at a different time, are found explicitly. The influence of a uniform, time‐varying magnetic field upon the model is discussed, and the frequency‐dependent magnetic susceptibility is found in the weak‐field limit. Some fluctuation‐dissipation theorems are derived which relate the susceptibility to the Fourier transform of the time‐dependent correlation function of the magnetization at equilibrium.},

@article{Mayer2004,
abstract = {The kinetic Glauber–Ising spin chain is one of the very few exactly solvable models of
 non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. Nevertheless, existing solutions do not yield tractable
 expressions for two-time correlation and response functions of observables involving products of
 more than one or two spins. We use a new approach to solve explicitly the full hierarchy of
 differential equations for the correlation and response functions. From this general solution follow
 closed expressions for arbitrary multispin two-time correlation and response functions, for the case
 where the system is quenched from equilibrium at T i > 0 to some arbitrary T ≥ 0. By way of
 application, we give the results for two- and four-spin two-time correlation and response functions.
 From the standard mapping, these also imply new exact results for two-time particle correlation and
 response functions in one-dimensional diffusion limited annihilation.},

@article{Skoge2013,
abstract = {Cooperativity arising from local interactions in equilibrium receptor systems provides gain, but does not increase sensory performance, as measured by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) due to a fundamental tradeoff between gain and intrinsic noise. Here we allow sensing to be a nonequilibrium process and show that energy dissipation cannot circumvent the fundamental tradeoff, so that the SNR is still optimal for independent receptors. For systems requiring high gain, nonequilibrium 2D-coupled receptors maximize the SNR, revealing a new design principle for biological sensors.},
