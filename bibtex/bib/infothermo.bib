abstract = {We introduce a metric for probability distributions, which is bounded, information-theoretically motivated, and has a natural Bayesian interpretation. The square root of the well-known $\chi$2 distance is an asymptotic approximation to it. Moreover, it is a close relative of the capacitory discrimination and Jensen-Shannon divergence.},
