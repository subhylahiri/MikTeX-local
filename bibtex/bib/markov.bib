We also consider the following marginalisability problem. Let {X(t)} = {(X1(t), X2(t),?, Xm(t))} be a continuoustime Markov chain. Under what conditions are the marginal processes {X1(t)}, {X2(t)},?, {Xm(t)} also continuous-time Markov chains? We show that this is related to lumpability and, if no two of the marginal processes can jump simultaneously, then they are continuous-time Markov chains if and only if they are mutually independent. Applications to ion channel modelling and birth-death processes are discussed briefly.},

@article{Kienker1989MarkovEquivalence,
abstract = {One cannot always distinguish different Markov models of ion-channel kinetics solely on the basis of steady-state kinetic data. If two generator (or transition) matrices are related by a similarity transformation that does not combine states with different conductances, then the models described by these generator matrices have the same observable steady-state statistics. This result suggests a procedure for expressing the model in a unique form, and sometimes reducing the number of parameters in a model. I apply the similarity transformation procedure to a number of simple models. When a model specifies the dependence of the rates of transition on an experimentally variable parameter such as the concentration of a ligand or the membrane potential, the class of equivalent models may be further restricted, but a model is not always uniquely determined even under these conditions. Voltage-step experiments produce non-stationary data that can also be used to distinguish models.},

abstract = "Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are one of the most fundamental and widely used statistical tools for modeling discrete time series. In general, learning \{HMMs\} from data is computationally hard (under cryptographic assumptions), and practitioners typically resort to search heuristics which suffer from the usual local optima issues. We prove that under a natural separation condition (bounds on the smallest singular value of the \{HMM\} parameters), there is an efficient and provably correct algorithm for learning HMMs. The sample complexity of the algorithm does not explicitly depend on the number of distinct (discrete) observationsit implicitly depends on this quantity through spectral properties of the underlying HMM. This makes the algorithm particularly applicable to settings with a large number of observations, such as those in natural language processing where the space of observation is sometimes the words in a language. The algorithm is also simple, employing only a singular value decomposition and matrix multiplications. "
