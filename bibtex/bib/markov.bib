We also consider the following marginalisability problem. Let {X(t)} = {(X1(t), X2(t),?, Xm(t))} be a continuoustime Markov chain. Under what conditions are the marginal processes {X1(t)}, {X2(t)},?, {Xm(t)} also continuous-time Markov chains? We show that this is related to lumpability and, if no two of the marginal processes can jump simultaneously, then they are continuous-time Markov chains if and only if they are mutually independent. Applications to ion channel modelling and birth-death processes are discussed briefly.},

@article{Kienker1989MarkovEquivalence,
abstract = {One cannot always distinguish different Markov models of ion-channel kinetics solely on the basis of steady-state kinetic data. If two generator (or transition) matrices are related by a similarity transformation that does not combine states with different conductances, then the models described by these generator matrices have the same observable steady-state statistics. This result suggests a procedure for expressing the model in a unique form, and sometimes reducing the number of parameters in a model. I apply the similarity transformation procedure to a number of simple models. When a model specifies the dependence of the rates of transition on an experimentally variable parameter such as the concentration of a ligand or the membrane potential, the class of equivalent models may be further restricted, but a model is not always uniquely determined even under these conditions. Voltage-step experiments produce non-stationary data that can also be used to distinguish models.},

abstract = "Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are one of the most fundamental and widely used statistical tools for modeling discrete time series. In general, learning \{HMMs\} from data is computationally hard (under cryptographic assumptions), and practitioners typically resort to search heuristics which suffer from the usual local optima issues. We prove that under a natural separation condition (bounds on the smallest singular value of the \{HMM\} parameters), there is an efficient and provably correct algorithm for learning HMMs. The sample complexity of the algorithm does not explicitly depend on the number of distinct (discrete) observations—it implicitly depends on this quantity through spectral properties of the underlying HMM. This makes the algorithm particularly applicable to settings with a large number of observations, such as those in natural language processing where the space of observation is sometimes the words in a language. The algorithm is also simple, employing only a singular value decomposition and matrix multiplications. "
