We also consider the following marginalisability problem. Let {X(t)} = {(X1(t), X2(t),?, Xm(t))} be a continuoustime Markov chain. Under what conditions are the marginal processes {X1(t)}, {X2(t)},?, {Xm(t)} also continuous-time Markov chains? We show that this is related to lumpability and, if no two of the marginal processes can jump simultaneously, then they are continuous-time Markov chains if and only if they are mutually independent. Applications to ion channel modelling and birth-death processes are discussed briefly.},

We also provide guidelines for switching between those representations on the basis of the size of the argument. The first and second linearizations of the exponential and logarithmic mappings provided here are based directly on the exponential formula for the solutions of systems of linear ordinary differential equations. This representation does not require the use of perturbation formulae for eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Our approach leads to workable and straightforward expressions for the first and second linearizations of the exponential and logarithmic mappings regardless of degeneracies in the spectral decomposition of the argument.
